            <li>Slowly mix water into the flour until all of the dry flour has been mixed (high moisture dough so it will look very wet).</li>

            <li>After the 4th fold, cover a baking pan with olive oil and put the dough onto the baking pan and let rest for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Make the dimples into the dough(<strong>SO FUN</strong>), and bake at 425 for 22 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes and enjoy!</li>
