        <ol>
            <li>You want to cover the pasta with salted water so that it barely covers the top of the layer of pasta.</li>
            <li>Allow water to boil and cook to al dente per box instructions, water should mostly have been absorbed by the pasta at this point.</li>
            <li>Now you will add the can of evaporated milk and set the heat to low.</li>
            <li>Add in the gochuchang and cheese and slowly stir until fully incorporated.</li>
