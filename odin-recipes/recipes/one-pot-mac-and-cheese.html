        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This simple recipe only takes about 10-15 minutes to cook and will be a hit at any party!</p>
        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Evaporated milk - 1 can</li>
            <li>Any pasta noodle of choice</li>
            <li>Any cheese of choice</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Gochuchang</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Steps</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>You want to cover the pasta with salted water so that it barely covers the top of the layer of pasta.</li>
            <li>Allow water to boil and cook to al dente per box instructions, water should mostly have been absorbed by the pasta at this point.</li>
            <li>Now you will add the can of evaporated milk and set the heat to low.</li>
            <li>Add in the gochuchang and cheese and slowly stir until fully incorporated.</li>
